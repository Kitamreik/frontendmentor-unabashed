## Overview
The overview for this design was inspired by Unabashed Con in Denver, Colorado.

### Links

## My process
Having been trained in coding from CodeSquad, I focused on assessing mobile first functionality, then adding CSS functionality, then refining my HTML, and finally adding a scrolling hamburger menu for JS emulation.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

It was a great practice in making a ticketing site for the Con! I appreciated the ease it took to code this. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<section class="content-container-2 side-scroll-mobile">
    <div class="card expansion line cosmic-latte">
      <!-- data for tracking the metrics -->
      <span>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-money-bill-1-wave"></i>
        <p>Help us reach our goals! We appreciate all the support!</p>
        <p>$89,914 of $100,000 backed</p>
        <p>5,007 total backers</p>
        <p>56 days left </p>
      </span>
    <!-- Progress bar -->
    <br>
    <span>
      <label for="file">Current Donor Progress:</label>
    <progress id="file" value="85" max="100"> 32% </progress>
    </span>
    </div>
  </section>
```
```css
/* Cards for Tiers */
.card {
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0;
    transition: 0.3s;
    width: 60%;
    max-width: 300px;
    padding: 2.5%;
    border-radius: 5px;
    align-content: center;
    display: flex;
    flex-grow: 1;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: space-evenly;
}
```
```js
alert("OMG- Are you ready to see what's going on in this realm of cosmic deliciousness? If you're ready, click ok!");
console.log("You're doing a great job, Kit");
```

Shoutout to CodeSquad for teaching me Markdown too :D

### Continued development

A version 2.0 of this site would potentially incorporate Back End functionality, so I could pass data through the app.


### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I have always appreciated W3schools. I really liked this resource and will use it going forward.
